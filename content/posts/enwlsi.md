# Navigating your way through the ENWLSI 300-430

I passed the ENWLSI 300-430 a few weeks ago and I this post is all about the certification, the bad and good chapters and all the great and boring facts about it. I will give both a technical view of the certification and my personal opinion on how Cisco decided to set up this exam, contents and arguments. Hope you like it!
(NB: this certification has been modified in September 2023)

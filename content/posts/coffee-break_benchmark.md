# Running after the real-time application shift
From my perspective after the Covid boom a lot of small to mid size businesses started doing more and more online meetings shifting the daily applications from web browsing or the web-based application, to real-time application. Therefore the wi-fi design which was born for 2.4 GHz, 802.11b rates, giving connectivity to barcode scanners in a warehouse, is forced to follow the application shift. Obviously the example is not perfect as we can easily separate the areas of a company and apply ad-hoc configurations for the most used application and for the type of client. We won't see the warehouse employee on MS Teams 8 hours a day and the marketing manager is unlikely to be walking around with barcode scanners in the upper floor offices.

In my opinion the wireless infrastructure for a big company needs at least a once a year "health check" with Cisco Prime reports or scripting, on-site RF analysis and application benchmarks with strict tests and parameters previously discussed with the customer. For smaller businesses making clear the limits of the infrastructure from the get go without all the marketing fluff is enough and periodic checks can be skipped.

Never trust the behavior of an application out of the box. The IT team and the network team must stress the application to see how it reacts in the harshest environment such as the wireless network and act accordingly. If we don't know how and when it performs bad how we know when it is acceptable or even a perfect service.

## Variables during the stress-test

## Inability to have everything under control

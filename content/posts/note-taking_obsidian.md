# Note-taking with Obsidian
In this article [[Hugo + Netlify + GitHub]] I talked about how I setup this website with my few programming skills. In those lines I mentioned frequently markdown files and Obsidian so in this article I'm going to explain how I organize and take notes. But first let's address some questions

##### *What is Obsidian?* 
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a free, open-source note-taking app which helps you link your notes to each other using hypertext with markdown files.

##### *Why I need to switch from OneNote, Google Drive or Evernote to Obsidian?*
You don't. You don't especially because Obsidian is a pain in the ass to configure and mantain a well-ordered list of notes, both useful and practical and cool-at-the-eyes, is not a simple task and I'm far from achiving it.

Although, I find this app very useful because with a keyboard shortcut I can open a new notes with a specific template like "Troubleshooting Cisco switch stack", link on the fly an old note called "Cisco command cheatsheet" or search all the notes tagged with "9300".

##### Is Obsidian a collaborative app? Are the notes automatically sync to a cloud?
Obsidian is not a native collaborative app but maybe there are some plugins and workaround to the lack of collaboration.
No, the files are store locally in your machine and even with the paid functionality [Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) there is no Obsidian cloud.

## First setup
These are my mandatory steps to do before start taking notes:

- Go to Settings
	- Options
		- Editor
			- Turn on **live preview** Editor -> under General you must disable Legacy Mode. Set Default editing mode to "Live Preview".
			- If you don't want a **centered text** go to Settings -> Editor -> under Display -> Readable line lenght
			- Turn on **fold heanding** and **fold indent** to collapse text under headings or lists
		- File and links
			- Setup the **new notes default folder**
			- Setup the **attachment folder**
		- Core plugins
			- Activate the templates plugin
		- Hotkeys
			- Set the `Toggle code` shortcut to `CTRL + SHIFT + <`
			- Template shortcut
2. Header collapsing
3. Write the first template
4. Readble line lenght adjustment
5. 

That's a lot :skull: but we are almost done.

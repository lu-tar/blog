I'm Luca from :it: and I work in the networking world since September 2017. After high-school I wasn't sure about starting university, so I attended a Cisco boot-camp held by a local system integrator. Before that course I didn't have any big working experiences excluding some short stages in two IT departments organized by my school.

During my high school year I have worked almost exclusively with programming languages like Java and the web trio CSS, HTML and PHP. I thank the professors who in those years sparked an interest in networking.

## What am I working on?
In 2022 I have been working mostly on Cisco wireless technologies based on AireOS, IOS XE and Meraki. From time to time the troubleshooting leads me to configure and analyze firewalls, Palo Alto being one of them. Occasionally I log onto Clearpass and Cisco ISE to analyze security flows. Regarding switches and routers (Cisco, Aruba and HPE), I have always been involved in maintenance and configuration of equipment already active in production. On rare occasions I have been involved on activities on Fortigate firewall, Fortigate WAF and Cisco ESA.

For 2023 I do not foresee any major changes regarding the technologies covered, but who knows, I could be wrong

In my free time I alternate an out-of-town travel and a beer with friends with projects like this website and small Python scripts.

## Why writing a blog?
I think that writing a blog combines well these things: 
- use cases, problems and projects from my personal work experience 
- what I'm studying at the moment - an opportunity to smooth the edges of my written English 
- since the article will be public, I force myself to take notes and consult the documentation more precisely 
- learn how to use the GitHub versioning of the code

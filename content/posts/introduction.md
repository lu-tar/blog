I'm Luca Tarozzi from Bologna, :it: . I started my journey in the networking world in September 2017 doing a Cisco CCENT bootcamp held by the system integrator where I still work today. Before that I didn't have any big working experiences excluding some stages in two IT departments organized by my school, IIS Odone Belluzzi. <br>
During my high school year I have worked almost exclusively with programming languages like Java and the web trio CSS, HTML and PHP. I thank my laziness and the professors who in those years made me hate programming and sparked an interest in networking.

## What am I working on?
If 2021 and 2022 were a restaurant menu, the main courses would be Cisco wireless and wired technologies with some appetizers and small samples of Palo Alto firewall and Cisco ESA. I don't deny that this "menu" may change in the future, we'll see. <br>
In my free time I alternate a beer with friends with projects like this website and small Python scripts.

## Why writing a blog?
I think that writing a blog combines these things well:
- use cases, problems and projects from my personal work experience
- what I'm studying at the moment
- an opportunity to smooth the edges of my written english
- since the article will be public I force myself to take notes and consult the documentation more precisely
- learn how to use the GitHub versioning of the code

Also I started this blog as a personal project without the presumption that it will become an authoritative source of information. Nevertheless, I will strive to make the articles less chaotic as possible.

## If you are interested in my CV
You can find it on my GitHub page as a resource of this Hugo-based webiste. I don't have any social network but fell free to visits my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luca-tarozzi-9ab371178/) o write email to `l.tar@protonmail.com`
